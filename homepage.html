    <p>Ou first retreat will kick off on June 18 and well end on June26, 2024. We are going to start in Kalymnos, Greece. This is going to be one of 
        many for Aionia. Kalymnos is an Island unlike any other. Still in its infancy of tourism, Kalymnos and the surrounding Islands remain the hidden
        <em>gems</em> of the Aegean. Kalymnos stays true to culture and traditional values, allowing yo uto immerse yourself into the culture the moment 
        you step foot on this beautiful rock. Since the Island is so secluded, everything is grown or caught locally, allowing for no tampering with,
        adding chemicals to the food.The dinig experienmces are a big part of this retreat. Our food heals us from the inside out; we are sure to set up
        environemnts where intentional eating is the focus.

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am a film enthusiast who in my older years became obsessed with art; the two bring me so much joy.
            I grew up watching the screen as if it was going to take me to that place and moment in time;
            half the time, I think it did.
