    <p>Our first retreat will kick off on June 18 and well end on June 26, 2024. We are going to start in Kalymnos, Greece. This is going to be one of 
        many for Aionia. Kalymnos is an Island unlike any other. Still in its infancy of tourism, Kalymnos and the surrounding Islands remain the hidden
        <em>gems</em> of the Aegean. Kalymnos stays true to culture and traditional values, allowing yo uto immerse yourself into the culture the moment 
        you step foot on this beautiful rock. Since the Island is so secluded, everything is grown or caught locally, allowing for no tampering with,
        adding chemicals to the food.The dinig experienmces are a big part of this retreat. Our food heals us from the inside out; we are sure to set up
        environemnts where intentional eating is the focus.

        <h3>About Aionia's reason for being</h3>
        <p>I started this business because as I grow older, I realize how presious time is. I spent my summers from 6 months old all the way into adulthood on
            this Island. It always broguht me back to life, is the reason I am the person I am today, and always helps me come back to myself. I have loved and lost
            on this Island, I have gained friendships that have lasted a lifetime. With the environment already being a healing elements of these trips, I wanted to join
            another factor that has helped me heal, yoga and associated wellness practices. We create these trips to not only be stress free, but also to help enhance the 
            sense; allowing to benefit from the experience in the most positive way.
